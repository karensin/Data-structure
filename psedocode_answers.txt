Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode because it helps programmers to develop algorithms and a way to express in plain english for people to read.  


If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
It would not run because of the difference in syntax. 



Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:


Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

	INPUT 	first number  
	INPUT 	second number  
	IF the first number is greater than second number THEN 
		PRINT 	first number
	ELSE 
	IF the	first number is less than second number THEN 
		PRINT second number
	END IF 

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

	INIT total to 0
	INPUT a number
	WHILE the number is less or equal to 100
		ADD number to total 
		INPUT a number
	END WHILE 	
	RETURN total 

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
	INPUT Object 
	INPUT inputName  
	IF the inputName is equal to the obj Name 
		PRINT obj Number
	ELSE 
		PRINT null
	END IF
Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.


var obj= {
  name:'karen',
  number:22323, 
  }
 

  function searchNumber (inputName,obj){
   if (inputName===obj.name){
     return obj.number 
   }
   else return null 
 }
