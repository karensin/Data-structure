Short Answer
What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: When we need to go through something and check each and every object. Let’s say there was a ring accidentally left inside 10 baguettes made at an hour interval each, our initial reaction is to search every single baguette, one by one to look for the ring, assuming the baguettes are still hot and making, we will need to go to the very first one made to start and on ward. 

What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Let’s say there was a ring accidentally left inside 10 baguettes made at different times, this time instead of blindly looking for the ring, we knew that we lost the ring at 12pm and only made 5 baguettes before 12 which left us the other 5 baguettes made after 12. With this information we can start by looking at the other half of the baguettes made after 12. 


Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7 iterations 

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 2 iterations 

Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear, because binary search only works under a sorted array because it depends on the mid value to look in the collections. 

Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary search because it’s more efficient since binary search would minimize the time to look for it. 


Programming Assignment:

You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function wordSearch (arr, word) {
    var low = arr[0];
    var high = arr[arr.length-1];
 
  while (low <= high) {
   var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high))/ 2
   mid=Math.round(mid);
 
    if (arr[mid] > word) {
      high = arr[mid - 1];
    }
     else if (arr[mid] < word) {
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    } else {
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return 'NOT FOUND';
}

var names = ["Aery", "Albatross", "Cassie", "Docle", "zander"];

 
console.log(wordSearch(names, "Albatross"));



You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.



var fishTank = ["Anableps","guppies","goldfish", "white-spotted goldfish"];

function findFish (arr,target){
  for(var i=0; i<arr.length;i++){
    if(arr[i]===target){
      return 'found white-spotted goldfish'
    }
  }
    return 'cannot find white-spotted goldfish '

}

findFish(fishTank,'white-spotted goldfish')
